# Nonlinear Optics Examples

This is a repository of jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of our [nonlinear and gaussian quantum optics](https://github.com/mcmahon-lab/MultimodeNonlinearOptics) simulation code for various applications.
These include both toy examples and more realistic simulations that can be used to predict experimental outcomes with some degree of accuracy.

The notebooks contain demonstrations of how to use the more important features of the library, including:
- how to set up and use the propagation equation solvers and the material property classes;
- find the Green's functions, covariance matrices, and their decompositions;
- design custom domain poling patterns.
